    <h1>Waakye(Ghanaian Rice and Beans)</h1>
    <p>One of the most beloved local dishes in Ghana is Waakye, a flavorful combination of rice and beans cooked with millet leaves. It's a staple street food and a favorite for breakfast or lunch.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups of rice </li>
<li>1 cup of black-eyed peas or cowpeas </li>
<li>1 handful of dried millet leaves </li>  
<li> Salt </li>
<li> Water </li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol> 
  <li> **Boil the Beans**:
   - In a large pot, add the soaked beans and enough water to cover them.
   - Add the millet leaves (or baking soda) to the pot. This gives Waakye its signature reddish-brown color.
   - Boil until the beans are tender (about 30–45 minutes). Remove the millet leaves once the desired color is achieved. </li>
   <li>**Add Rice**:
   - Wash the rice thoroughly and add it to the pot with the beans.
   - Add more water if needed to cover the rice and beans.
   - Add salt to taste. </li>
   <li> **Cook Together**:
   - Cover and cook on medium heat until the rice is soft and the water is fully absorbed (about 20–25 minutes).
   - Stir occasionally to prevent burning at the bottom. </li>
   <li>**Serve**:
   - Waakye is traditionally served with a variety of sides such as:
     - Fried plantains
     - Gari (grated cassava)
     - Boiled eggs
     - Spaghetti
     - Avocado </li>
